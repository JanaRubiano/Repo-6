7. Write a program that given 5 numbers calculates: Average, median, multiplicative average, numbers in acending order, numbers in descending order, the largest value to the power of the smallest value, and the cubic root of the smallest value.

8. For the previous point, import the functions to a file for their use.

9. Research what pip is in python and how it works.

    PIP is a package manager for python modules or packages. The PIP install package command looks for the package that was asked for in PyPi and installs it. PyPi       is the Python Package Index, which is an online repository for public packages.

10. Make a list of popular python modules that can be installed with pip and how to install them.
    
    First of all, a module is a file with Python code, a library is a collection of modules and a package is a library that can be installed with a package manager.
    
    Those are some of the most popular python libraries (or packages):

    - TensorFlow
    - Scikit-Learn
    - Numpy
    - Keras
    - PyTorch
    - LightGBM
    - Eli5
    - SciPy
    - Theano
    - Pandas
    
    There are also built_in python modules, some are:
    - math
    - collections
    - datetime
    - random
    - sys
    - logging
    - time
    - os

    To install a package from the command line, type the following:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy # Or any other package.
    ```
